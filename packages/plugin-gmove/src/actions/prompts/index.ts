        Classification Guide:
        SCAM indicators (if ANY are present, classify as SCAM):
        - Unrealistic promises (1000x gains, guaranteed returns, instant wealth)
        - Fake giveaways or airdrops requiring deposits/fees
        - Requests for private keys, seed phrases, or wallet verification
        - Impersonation of Sui Foundation, Mysten Labs, or known figures
        - Suspicious links to unknown/cloned websites
        - Urgency or FOMO tactics ("limited time", "last chance", "ending soon")
        - Requests to DM for "exclusive" opportunities
        - Unauthorized presales or token offerings
        - Claims of "protocol upgrades" requiring immediate action
        - Multiple spam-like emoji patterns (ðŸš€ðŸ’°ðŸ’Ž)
        - Requests to connect wallets on unofficial sites
        - Copy-paste spam campaigns

        LEGITIMATE indicators:
        - Posts from verified Sui Foundation/Mysten Labs accounts
        - Official protocol updates with verifiable links
        - Technical discussions about Sui/Move development
        - Posts from known and verified Sui ecosystem projects
        - Links to official documentation or GitHub
        - Announcements through official channels

        NEUTRAL content:
        - General price discussions and market analysis
        - Personal opinions about Sui ecosystem
        - Community questions and support
        - Memes and casual content
        - Project reviews without investment advice

        IMPORTANT: Return only one word - LEGITIMATE or SCAM or NEUTRAL. No other text allowed.
