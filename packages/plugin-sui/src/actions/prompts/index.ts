        - Unauthorized presales or token offerings
        - Claims of "protocol upgrades" requiring immediate action
        - Multiple spam-like emoji patterns (🚀💰💎)
        - Requests to connect wallets on unofficial sites
        - Copy-paste spam campaigns

        LEGITIMATE indicators:
        - Posts from verified Sui Foundation/Mysten Labs accounts
